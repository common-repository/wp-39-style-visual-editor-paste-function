== Description ==

Restores the Paste function in the TinyMCE rich text editor to the way Wordpress 3.9 was. Well, almost. I tried my best to replace Wordpress 3.9's TinyMCE paste function as it was working on my site.

In Wordpress 4.0, pasting rich text copies over extraneous unnecessary formatting. This plugin should restore to the way Wordpress 3.9 TinyMCE pasting was.

== Installation ==

1. Upload 'wp-39-style-visual-editor-paste-function' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. That's all!
